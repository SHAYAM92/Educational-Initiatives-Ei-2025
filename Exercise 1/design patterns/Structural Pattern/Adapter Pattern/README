Adapter Pattern
Media Player Adapter
Overview

This project implements a media player adapter using the Adapter design pattern. The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. In this example, MediaAdapter allows an advanced media player (e.g., VlcPlayer, Mp4Player) to be used with a standard media player interface (AudioPlayer).

Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

MediaPlayer Interface: An interface with a play method that all media players must implement.
AdvancedMediaPlayer Interface: An interface for advanced media players with methods playVlc and playMp4.
VlcPlayer, Mp4Player: Concrete classes implementing the AdvancedMediaPlayer interface.
MediaAdapter: An adapter class that implements the MediaPlayer interface and delegates calls to an instance of AdvancedMediaPlayer.
AudioPlayer: A class that uses the MediaAdapter to play different types of media files.
Main: A class to demonstrate the use of MediaAdapter with AudioPlayer.
