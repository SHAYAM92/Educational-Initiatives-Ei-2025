Factory Pattern
Shape Factory
Overview

This project implements a shape factory using the Factory design pattern. The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. In this example, ShapeFactory creates different types of shapes like Circle, Rectangle, and Square.

Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

Shape Interface: An interface with a draw method that all shapes must implement.
Circle, Rectangle, Square: Concrete classes that implement the Shape interface.
ShapeFactory: A factory class that creates instances of different shapes based on the provided input.
Main: A class to demonstrate the creation of shapes using the ShapeFactory.
